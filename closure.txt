1) "proc {Add B C E} ... end" is a syntatic sugar to represent "Add = proc {$ B C E}". Therefore, the procedure code of the procedure value does not contain the identifier Add.

2) "Add -> a" is not contained in the contextual environment of a.

3) Only D is a free indentifier. The procedure value only contains {D->d} in its contextual environment part.
